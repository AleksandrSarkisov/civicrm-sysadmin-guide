# Switching CMS platforms

This section provides instructions for moving your CiviCRM installation from being installed within one CMS to being installed within another.  If you are changing server at the same time, please also refer to the instructions on [Moving an Existing Installation to a New Server or Location](switch-servers.md).

The subpages in this section are named in the following "format":

**Current CMS** to **New CMS**

We currently have guides for:

* [Joomla to Drupal](switching-cms/joomla-to-drupal.md)
* [Drupal to Wordpress](switching-cms/drupal-to-wordpress.md)
* [Drupal to Backdrop](switching-cms/drupal-to-backdrop.md)
