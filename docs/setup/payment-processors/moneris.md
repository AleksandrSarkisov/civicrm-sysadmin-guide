# Moneris Configuration Guide

## Overview

Moneris is a Canadian transaction processor, working with most of the major credit cards and now direct payment cards as well. There is a US version of the Moneris API out there, but it hasn't been implemented yet.

There was an implementation of a CiviCRM plugin for Moneris in early versions of CiviCRM, but due to licensing issues, it was removed.

Instead, there are now two extensions available that allow you to use Moneris, one using a "post" method, and one using a "hosted pay page".

## Post

Read the [extension's README](https://github.com/adixon/ca.civicrm.moneris/blob/master/README.md). It should only be used for one-time credit card payments in Canada.

## Hosted Pay Page

Here is a brief description of how you go about setting up Moneris Hosted to work with CiviCRM 4.x

1. Install the Moneris extension.

2. You should now be able to view the following screen when you set up extension for Moneris Hosted Payment Processor.

3. The next thing is to configure Moneris eSELECT Plus Hosted Paypage . The following configuration steps are required under your Moneris eSELECT Plus merchant account.Please ensure you have your merchant account set up on moneris before continuing.

4. Log into the Merchant Resource Center: [Developement](https://esqa.moneris.com/mpg/index.php) [Production](https://www3.moneris.com/mpg)

    Before you can send a transaction to the Hosted Paypage you will need to configure several settings through the eSELECTplus Merchant Resource Centre (MRC).
     To log into the MRC test environment go to [https://esqa.moneris.com/mpg](https://esqa.moneris.com/mpg) and use one of the following login IDs.
    
    | Store ID | Username | Password |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | store1 | demouser | password |
    | store2 | demouser | password |
    | store3 | demouser | password |

    1. Navigate to Admin -> Hosted Config
    
        Once you have successfully logged in, click on the “ADMIN” menu item on the left and then in the submenu that appears click on “HOSTED CONFIG”.
        
        To create a new Hosted Paypage configuration, click on “Generate a New Configuration”. You will be assigned a Hosted Paypage ID (ps_store_id). This is the identifier for this unique configuration. You will also be assigned a Hosted Paypage Token (hpp_key). The Hosted Paypage ID and Token are sent as part of the transaction request to securely identify your store and the specific configuration.
