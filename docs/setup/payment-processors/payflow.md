# PayFlow Link

## Payflow Link Configuration

Payflow Link is a Paypal offered payment processor which provides off-site processing of payments. You do not require an SSL certificate to use Payflow Link.

The code for Payflow Link is available from the [Extension repository](http://civicrm.org/extensions/payflowlink). Install the extension from

yoursite.com/civicrm/admin/extensions&reset=1

## Setting up paypal manager

Payflow Link does not supply test credentials - you need to test with your live credentials in test mode. You can configure your account by logging into

[https://manager.paypal.com/](https://manager.paypal.com/)

Partner = paypal

Merchant Login = the username you have been supplied

User = you won't have one initially (and I haven't tried to create one)

Password = the password you have been supplied

There are obviously a lot of things you can configure but the ones I am going to cover are under service settings/ configuration. Also refer to [https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/vhelp/paypalmanager_help/configuration.htm](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/vhelp/paypalmanager_help/configuration.htm)

1. Return URL Method - you must set this to POST
1. Return URL - the standard drupal URL looks something like this. `http://example.org/sites/all/modules/civicrm/extern/payFlowLinkIPN.php`. If you put the URL in your browser you should see "Failure: Missing Parameter"
1. Silent Post URL - tick this & set it to the same as the return URL
1. Force silent post confirmation - if the server can't access your website for any reason the transaction will be reversed - I am inclined to think this shouldn't be enabled
1. Transaction Process mode : test or live
1. Billing information - the customer will be required to fill out the required fields and given the option of filling out the editable fields
1. Shipping information - unless you are shipping product leave these unchecked

    There are various presentation options that should be fairly self-explanatory - try here for more [paypal config](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/vhelp/paypalmanager_help/configuration.htm).
 
Security

![](../../img/payflow-security.jpg)

Once again the [paypal config](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/vhelp/paypalmanager_help/configuration.htm) page is a good source of info but note that at the moment csc checking and AVS checking are not supported in that a transaction that fails due to either of these security measures will be voided at Payflow but will be treated as a success by CiviCRM (see proposed improvements). CSC checking is checking the 3 numbers on the credit card. AVS is checking the address supplied against the credit card address.

Accepted URLS - you should put the URL for your site/s in these fields. Only browsers coming from those sites will be accepted.

## Testing

Use test credit card credentials while in test mode: The $ amount you use will determine the pass or failure

card 4111111111111111

visa

any future date

## Limitations / Proposed improvements

1. GET vs POST. This is common to all off-site processors in Civi at the moment. The recommended behaviour is to send the user off-site using an HTTP POST request which means they can't see / edit the request. If you have configured Paypal Manager to accept paypal payments then the page they land on will show the civicrm url attributes. If you haven't they will still be able to use the back button to get to it. CiviCRM does check the invoice id & amount match the contribution number when it succeeds so it is not easy to use this in a malicious way. Your user login it exposed but not your password. Presumably 'pay by paypal' links do this al the time. It would be more ideal for the CiviCRM page to POST to payflow. This does require a change in CiviCRM core code & the difficulty is with quickform POSTing to an prescribed URL

TYPE=S&LOGIN=yourloginn&PARTNER=PAYPAL&AMOUNT=1.00&COMMENT1=civicrm contact ID 274&COMMENT2=contribution id 3190&DESCRIPTION=Online Contribution%3A Donate to our fund to buy a Chinese Pole&INVOICE=3190&USER1=274&USER2=2cd150f088d888943596266a890874f6&USER7=contribute, a7147c02b36a45274acba2020a04a798_3305&USER8=1

1. Passing through Billing details: At the moment payflow link is not passing address details backwards & forwards successfully - I think ideally the same billing block would be displayed as on the payment processors that are handled on-site & a new type would be introduced that uses GET
1. Potentially AVS & CSV support should be added
1. Extension packaging - this is for purposes of future proofing
1. Testing - I need to confirm how completely it has been tested - per <https://docs.civicrm.org/dev/en/latest/extensions/payment-processors/create/#testing>
